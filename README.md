# redmapper_lensing_tests
A series of systematics tests for the DES Y1 redMaPPer weak lensing measurements.

## Requirements

Some of the code here will require the [cluster toolkit](https://github.com/tmcclintock/cluster_toolkit). I've included CLASS power spectra that I generated in the repository, so you don't need that installed either.
